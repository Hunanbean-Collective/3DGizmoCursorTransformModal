# 3DGizmoCursorTransformModal
Allows the Blender Cursor to be Moved as if it was a normal 3D object. Modal or Gizmo.


Run the .py in the Scripting window, or make a Plugin out of it.

If it happens to lose Sync for some reason, click on the CursorVisualizer in the Outliner, and it should go back to functioning properly.
