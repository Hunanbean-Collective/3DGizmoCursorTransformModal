# 3DGizmoCursorTransformModal
Allows the Blender Cursor to be Moved as if it was a normal 3D object. Modal or Gizmo.


Run the .py in the Scripting window, or make a Plugin out of it.
It will automatically create a helper Empty in the Outliner, called CursorVisualizer, in what ever collection is selected at the time of running the Script.
This is a required helper. AKA, do not delete unless you no longer want the functionality of this script.
If you do delete it, you can always just run the Script again.
If it happens to lose Sync for some reason, click on the CursorVisualizer in the Outliner, and it should go back to functioning properly.
