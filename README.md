# 3DGizmoCursorTransformModal
Allows the Blender Cursor to be Moved as if it was a normal 3D object. Modal or Gizmo.<br><br><br>


Run the .py in the Scripting window, or make a Plugin out of it.<br>
It will automatically create a helper Empty in the Outliner, called CursorVisualizer, in what ever collection is selected at the time of running the Script.<br>
This is a required helper. AKA, do not delete unless you no longer want the functionality of this script.<br>
If you do delete it, you can always just run the Script again.<br>
If it happens to lose Sync for some reason, click on the CursorVisualizer in the Outliner, and it should go back to functioning properly.<br><br>
